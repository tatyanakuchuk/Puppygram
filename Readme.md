## Step 1
- create a repository: run `git init` in this directory. Git creates the.git directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located.

- create a branch and switch to it.

-in the main.js file, write a utility function that will return a random integer from the given range, inclusive. The range should be positive, including zero. Also, consider how the function should behave if the 'from' value is less than the 'to' value or equal to it.

-write a function to check the maximum length of a string. It will be used to validate the length of entered comments but should be universal. The result should be either true or false.
